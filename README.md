Summary 

What is it? Think of this as your elevator pitch for your product. Limit it to a few sentences. 
Joice is a web application that helps individuals journal their thoughts in the moment through voice and have them automatically transcribed for easier organization and access. This provides a simple outlet for users to unload their thoughts and stay more mindful during the day.

Problem Background 

Who is the customer and what is the need or problem we’re addressing? Why should we address this problem now? What are all of the things we know? How do we know this is a problem? 
Example Users: Students, creatives, people who want to get into journaling
Journaling is defined as “entering or recording daily thoughts, experiences, etc.” and according to a study about half of us have written in a journal at some point in our lives, and somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 in 6 people are active journal writers right now. 
Journaling has many benefits which includes evoking mindfulness and helping writers remain present while keeping perspective. It also presents an opportunity for emotional catharsis and helps the brain regulate emotions by allowing the brain to unload and stay unclogged.
Despite all these benefits, many people don’t partake in journaling at all or when they do journal, they have a difficult time making it a habit and continuing every day. A study found that after the first two weeks, the amount of people who continued to journal every day gradually decreased. There are many reasons people avoid journaling including the fact that it’s time-consuming and there isn’t instant gratification. Journaling is a process that takes time and it allows for a cultivation of self-identity and self-confidence in the long term.
While there are many journaling apps out in the market, there isn’t an effective solution that provides a simple platform for jotting down unadulterated thoughts with no formality. There is a need for a solution to lower the barrier of entering the world of “journaling” for busy people


Goals

Talk about the general high-level goals of doing this work. What are we trying to accomplish by solving the problem? 
By creating a simple and quick way to record their thoughts or experiences at any moment and having them transcribed to text automatically, users will be able to get into the action of journaling without realizing or much commitment. Journaling doesn’t have to be a formal writing process with prompts or your daily diary, it can simply be an action of unloading whatever is on the user’s mind with no judgment or no formality.

Proposed Solution 

What are you proposing is the solution to the problem being tackled? Keep this to a few sentences, again focusing on the WHAT, not the HOW.
Problem Statement: How might we make the experience of journaling more intuitive and exciting for busy people so that they become more present and mindful in their lives? 

The product will provide an easy way to record any thoughts or experiences a user might have during their day and each recording can be called an “entry”. This will address two pain points in journaling which are not having any instant gratification and it being time-consuming. Each recording or “entry” will show a celebration animation with the entry number and also will be transcribed to text automatically afterwards. There could be a streak feature to enforce the habit of recording thoughts if needed.
The app will also have a library of the entries, sorted by the time and day of the recordings to mimic the aesthetic of a real journal or diary. This will allow users to review their progress, revisit their old recordings/transcriptions and reflect on their days.
